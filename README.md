# FBref Premier League Data Scraper & Visualizer

This repository contains the code for a sophisticated application that leverages React and Node.js to scrape and visualize football data from FBref. The application focuses on Premier League players, offering users the ability to search and access detailed statistical data on any player within the league.
## Background
My current GitHub project is a sophisticated application that utilizes React and Node.js to scrape and visualize football data from FBref, a premier sports statistics platform. This application is centered around Premier League players, offering users the ability to search and obtain detailed statistical data on any player within the league.

One significant feature of this project is its efficient data extraction and visualization capabilities. The application skillfully scrapes pertinent data from FBref and then uses advanced data visualization techniques to present this information in an engaging and understandable way.

Incorporating Chakra UI, a popular open-source JavaScript library, has been a critical enhancement to this project. This library has greatly improved the application's aesthetic and usability. Chakra UI has made it easier to create a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface, offering users an intuitive experience across different devices and screen sizes.

To ensure optimum efficiency and limit overusing FBref's resources, I've integrated a robust data caching feature. This not only stores previous search data for quicker retrieval but also significantly improves the application's response times and user experience.

The project also stands as a testament to my journey of exploration and growth in technology. A shift from Python, typically used for data scraping, to Node.js was an enlightening experience. It provided a fresh perspective and an intriguing challenge, broadening my coding skills and my understanding of data scraping possibilities.

This application is a significant upgrade from a similar project I developed during the summer of 2020 using Python and React. The current version, with its integration of Node.js and Chakra UI, showcases improved performance, a polished user interface, and an enhanced user experience.

The codebase is neatly organized, and the documentation is thorough, making it an excellent learning resource for those interested in React, Node.js, data scraping, and visualization. The project continues to evolve, with future updates focused on extending its functionality, further improving user experience, and ensuring it remains a premier tool in the realm of sports data visualization.
## Features

- Efficient data extraction and visualization: The application scrapes data from FBref and presents it in an understandable and engaging way using advanced data visualization techniques.
- Chakra UI integration: The application utilizes Chakra UI, a popular open-source JavaScript library, to create a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface.
- Data caching: To prevent overuse of FBref's resources and to speed up data retrieval, the application implements a robust data caching mechanism.

## Running Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeromeoP/footballStatsScraping.git
```

2. Navigate to the `fbref-scraper` directory:

```bash
cd fbref-scraper
```

3. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

4. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project's root directory and start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer to run these commands. Once both the server and frontend are running, you can access the application via your local browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Development

The project is continuously evolving, with future updates focusing on extending its functionality and ensuring it remains a leading tool in sports data visualization.
