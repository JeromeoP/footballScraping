# FBref Premier League Data Scraper & Visualizer

This repository contains the code for a sophisticated application that leverages React and Node.js to scrape and visualize football data from FBref. The application focuses on Premier League players, offering users the ability to search and access detailed statistical data on any player within the league.

## Features

- Efficient data extraction and visualization: The application scrapes data from FBref and presents it in an understandable and engaging way using advanced data visualization techniques.
- Chakra UI integration: The application utilizes Chakra UI, a popular open-source JavaScript library, to create a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface.
- Data caching: To prevent overuse of FBref's resources and to speed up data retrieval, the application implements a robust data caching mechanism.

## Running Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the `fbref-scraper` directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd fbref-scraper
\`\`\`

3. Start the server:

\`\`\`bash
node server.js
\`\`\`

4. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project's root directory and start the frontend:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer to run these commands. Once both the server and frontend are running, you can access the application via your local browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Development

The project is continuously evolving, with future updates focusing on extending its functionality and ensuring it remains a leading tool in sports data visualization.
